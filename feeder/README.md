# Introduction

Feeders have the responsibility to supply components to the machine. To have a high quality, in all the pick & place process, it's mandatory that feeders supply components in a reliable and precise way. Supplying a component is the first step of the pick & place process, so , the more precission on feeders, the more precission on the final place possition, because less corrections will be required in the next steps.

If you have enough money, you can buy feeders used in the industry by US $130 each. This was not our case, because:

* We need to mount at least 40 feeders on our machine, and we don't have US $5,200.
* Usually these feeders are pneumatic feeders, and a lot of additional noisy hardware is required (more money).

For the above reasons, we decided to work in our own feeder solution, after review the [Volker Besmens's project](https://www.vbesmens.de/en/pick-and-place/automatic-feeder.html).
