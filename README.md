[Witecat](https://whitecatboard.org) was created in 2016 as an ecosystem to provide hardware and software to everyone to deploy real IOT use cases in an easy way. Once the hardware was designed, we had to decide how to assemble it, and after analyzing various options we decided that, in a first stage, the best way was to produce our own units. Due to that, we started the construction of our own Pick&Place machine, based on [OpenBuilds](https://openbuilds.com), [OpenPNP](http://openpnp.org), and some custom hardware.
